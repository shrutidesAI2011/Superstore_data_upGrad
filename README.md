# Superstore_data_upGrad

You are a sales manager at Superstore Sales- one of Canada’s largest retail stores. You need to send a report to your manager containing a summary of sales for the Corporate customer segment.
The dataset superstore_sales.xlsx is provided below. Most of the data headers are self-explanatory. However, for clarity, following are the meanings of a few data headers:
Region: Analogous to a large state in Canada.
Province: A district within Region.
Product Base Margin: Profit margin on a product.

The final report is to be made for only the Corporate customer segment. 
 
Section 1: Basic Formatting
* Increase the column widths to appropriate sizes so that they are readable.
* Format the header row in a suitable colour and put borders around the header row cells.

Section 2: Filtering
* Filter the data by customer segment.
* Create four new worksheets, one for each customer segment.
* Copy raw data of each customer segment into the respective worksheet.
* Now you’ll have four individual sheets, one for each customer segment. For this assignment, you only have to work with the Corporate customer segment (this point onwards).

Section 3: Report Making - I
* Freeze the header row.
* Delete or hide any unwanted columns.
* Hint: Decide judiciously between which columns should be deleted / hidden.
* Round off sales and profits to one decimal place.
* Format sales and profit in US dollar units.
* Format the Order Date and Ship Date into a more readable format (say 15-Jan 2012, or choose a format that you find the most readable).

Section 4: Report Making - II
* Sorting:Sort alphabetically by Region.
* Within Region, sort alphabetically by Province.
* Within Province, sort in decreasing order of sales.

Conditional Formatting - I:
* Within every Region, highlight the top 10% orders by sales in light green fill and dark green border.

Conditional Formatting - II:
* To help your manager understand profits better, highlight profits in a scale of green and losses in a scale of red (Higher the profit, darker the shade of green; More the loss, darker the shade of red).
* Learning Tip: Learn how to apply multiple conditional formattings in one column.

 
Section 5: Report Making - III:
*NApply double bottom borders to demarcate every Region.

 
Section 6: Printing, Saving and Exporting to PDF
* Experiment with different page layout options to fit the report in minimum number of pages.
* Apply password protection to the worksheet
* Save a printable version
